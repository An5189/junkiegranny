	Hello, World! Its's me, Junkie Granny. This first post is big for me. It's a short and simple test post, but such an imortant moment for me. I've worked so hard to learn how to build and code my own website. It's been a long road for me, and I gave up many times. Tears of frustration are now becoming tears of pride, not only for this moment, but also the plans I have for the future of this website. "OH MY!! Junkie Granny is live y'all!! The preview is simple and basic but the process of building my website from the ground up feels amazing. Thanks for reading. Y'all come back now, Ya' hear?
